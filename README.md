# Lite-OS
a small and light operating system, originally created by a friend of mine named saul, but, he cannot do it alone, since he was the only programmer, so he discontinued or stopped the project, but it is very likely that he has discontinued it, like this that I will continue to advance the project, no matter what it costs. -elThomas54
